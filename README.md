# P0-IWCARCARE

# Project 0: Dodge the Creeps
A tutorial implementation by Isaac Carcare.

This project follows the [Your First Game tutorial from
godotengine.org](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html).

## Project Report
From this project due to my unfamiliarity with both Godot Engine and Git Bash I found several things challenging from this assignment, I found it hard sometimes to figure out how to do what the tutorial was asking of me and find settings or options within godot engine, godot engine seems very interesting to me though and I am looking forward to working with it more over the course of the semester. I took a class in highschool where we used game-maker and godot seems similar in many regards, but seems much easier to work with controls as well as sound effect and music, which is something that pleasantly suprised me and i look forward to utilizing. As for working with Git Bash and setting up the .gitignore files I had extreme difficulty and ultimately failed in regards to that part of the assignment. My expousure to Git/Github has been entirely from things like intelliJ and pushing to github that way and I was completely lost when it came to working with command line git. 

### Criteria:
- [X] D-1 The repository link is submitted before the project deadline.
- [X] C-1 The tutorial has been completed.
- [ ] B-1 Your .gitignore file is correctly specified in the repository.
- [X] A-1 The project report is complete as per the instructions.

I was able to follow along for the actual godot tutorial decently well but became lost in attempting to work with command line git and failed to meet the objective of setting up the .gitignore. As for the project report I believe it to be complete as to the instructions. Being honnest my work is rough, and lacking the .gitignore and most certainly falls into the D to C range grade wise, I need to become proficent with comand line git Asap as I assume we will be using it frequently.
